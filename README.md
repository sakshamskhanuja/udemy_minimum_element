## Minimum Element

### Description

Write a method called <b>readIntegers</b>, that reads a comma delimited list of numbers, entered by the user from the console, and then returns an <b>array</b>, containing those numbers that were entered.

Next, write a method called <b>findMin</b>, that takes the array as an argument, and returns the minimum value found in the array.

In the <b>main</b> method:

<ul>
<li>Call the method <b>readIntegers</b>, to get the array of integers from the user, and print these out, using a method found in <b>Arrays</b>.</li>
<li>Next, call the <b>findMin</b> method, passing in the array, returned from the call to the <b>readIntegers</b> method.</li>
<li>Print the minimum element in the array, which should be returned from the <b>findMin</b> method.</li>
</ul>

<b>Note</b>: Assume that the user will only enter numbers, so you don't need to do any validation from the console input.
